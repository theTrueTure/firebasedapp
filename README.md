# Firebase Web Codelab - Start code

Tried making a chat app using firebase, went pretty well! The instructions to create your own is below.

"This folder contains the starting code for the [Firebase: Build a Real Time Web Chat App Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/).

If you'd like to jump directly to the end and see the finished code head to the [web](../web) directory."
